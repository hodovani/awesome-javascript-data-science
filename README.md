# Awesome JavaScript Data Science [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

A curated list of awesome libraries for doing data science that can run in your
browser or Node.js environment. That doesn't just mean Javascript: thanks to WebAssembly, many data
science libraries from other languages are now available in the browser.
